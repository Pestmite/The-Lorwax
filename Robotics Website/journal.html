          <h2><br>Robot<br></h2>
            <h3>October</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We researched and found the parts we need to build the robot. For example, we developed a claw design to use. We also taught the new members of the team how to organize, and put their ideas into actions and words.
              <br><br>
              </article>
            <h3>November</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We did a lot this month. We bought most of the pieces we researched in October, and we created prototypes for many of the essential functions out of cardboard, including many iterations of lifts and ramps. We also developed a practice field that will be extremely useful in future tests of the robot. The claw is now fully printed! We also worked on a design for the 3D model of the ramp and even soldered the wires to the motors. We worked on different ways to prevent game pieces from falling off the robot.

              </article>
            <h3>December</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">This month we worked on many things. We designed and 3D-printed the launcher and also attached gears to the motor. We made the center target for the game and the structure for the launcher. The robot is now functional and we tested and programmed the claw for it. We attached the launcher with a hole for the motor and brainstormed on an optimal location for the kill switch.

              </article>
            <h3>January</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We made the lift claw functional and game pieces with a rope & pulley system. We 3D printed a new spindle for the rope from the lift to wind onto. We had to reposition the support for the launcher so the claw wouldn’t damage the support and we reinforced the structure of the robot by adding some excursion. We finished attaching the CRCStop and 3D designed the parts for the dropper into the launcher. We unfortunately had to reprint the claw because it broke. We attached the wheels and the flywire. Everything is now functional.

          <h2><br>Kiosk<br></h2>
            <h3>October</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We brainstormed, and put up panels on the walls and primed them for painting. We found the best kind of material to make the Truffula trees would be paper rather than feather boa; it’s more eco-friendly, which we’d figure the Lorax would be happy about.

              </article>
            <h3>November</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">This was a very productive month! We designed and built various decorations for the kiosk, including a giant Lorax mustache, a sign advertising the Thneed, paper mache structures out of newspaper glue and balloons and the base for the marshmallow toss game. We painted the walls, starting with the grass and trees, then moving on to the sky, the water and the cityscape.

            <h3>December</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We got the wood panels for the bear game. Before working with the new pieces, we finished the catch basket for the marshmallows and screwed them together. We cut the wood panels and sanded them and even attached L brackets. Some team members also worked on a marshmallow counting system for bear game.

              </article>
            <h3>January</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We coded the bear game counting mechanism and decided to incorporate the O’Hare blimp as a model that would move with motors. We decided to make the blimp with paper mache with a skeleton inside. We used a 3D design website to determine the dimensions of the blimp and then  cut up cardboard pieces into different sized circles for the skeleton. We painted the blimp and the kiosk is done

          <h2><br>Website<br></h2>
            <h3>October</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">In these first meetings, a lot of work had to be done to organize the team into separate groups focused on accomplishing different tasks. For this, we created a document in which our roles and current progress could be easily tracked. People got to know each other and the team started to come together.
              <br><br>
              </article>
            <h3>November</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We began writing in our own Journal, and made contact with the other teams to ensure communication was at a maximum and the interviews could be conducted digitally. Many of the team members followed tutorials on HTML, the programming language crucial to the development of this site, and those already familiar began testing and creating prototypes. Members of the programming team mainly focused on preliminary questions to sharpen their skills with the Python programming language. Work on the Lorax video game started, and Matteo made a playable prototype.

            <h3>December</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We finished the School and Club bios, the competition description and the theme description in both English and French. The team improved the visuals for the Lorax minigame, with a sky background, and obstacles like trees and a ramp. We also took the bio pictures for each member of the website, and made a little Lorax mustache as a photo prop.

              </article>
            <h3>January</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">The last month before submission! It was time to make our final edits, polish up the visuals and check for bugs. We painted all the backgrounds in photoshop and designed the interface, and finished translation of the remaining text. Finally, we credited the creators of the Lorax and other assets we used, and wrote this entry!

          <h2><br>Media<br></h2>
            <h3>October</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">We started and finished making the script in Octobre. Once that was done, we started working on filming and filmed most of the scenes not involving our film's hero, the Lorwax.

            <h3>November</h3>

            <h3>January</h3>
              <article class="content-text journal-paragraph">As it was our last month to work on this, we worked very hard to finish the editing and sinking up the sound. The video was officially completed by mid-month.
